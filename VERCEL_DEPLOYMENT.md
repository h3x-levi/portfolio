# Vercel Deployment Guide

This document explains how to deploy to Vercel with preview vs production deployments.

## Deployment Types

### Preview Deployments (Automatic)
- **Triggered by:** Pull requests, feature branches
- **URL:** `https://portfolio-<random>.vercel.app`
- **Use case:** Testing changes before merging to main

### Production Deployment
- **Triggered by:** Merging to `main` branch
- **URL:** `https://portfolio.vercel.app` (or your custom domain)
- **Use case:** Live portfolio website

## Current Setup

Your Vercel project is configured to:

1. **Automatically deploy preview versions** when you push to branches other than `main`
2. **Deploy to production** only when you merge/push to the `main` branch

## How to Use

### For Preview Testing
1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

3. Push to GitHub (this will trigger a preview deployment):
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Vercel will automatically create a preview URL. You'll see it in:
   - GitHub pull request comments
   - Vercel dashboard

5. Test the preview URL on mobile and desktop

6. When ready, merge the PR to `main` for production deployment

### For Direct Main Branch Pushes
If you push directly to `main`:
```bash
git push origin main
```
This will deploy to **production** automatically.

## To Prevent Production Deployment

If you want to test on main without deploying to production:

1. Create a pull request instead of pushing directly:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

2. Test the preview URL generated by Vercel

3. Once satisfied, merge the PR

## Environment Variables

If you need environment variables:
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add variables (they'll be available in `process.env.VITE_*`)

## Rollback

If you need to rollback production:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Deployments tab
3. Find the previous production deployment
4. Click "Promote to Production"

## Tips

- Always test on preview first
- Use descriptive branch names
- Create PRs for review before merging to main
- Monitor the Vercel dashboard for deployment status
